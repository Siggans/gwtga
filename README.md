# gwtga, A Guild Wars 2 Guild Audit Project

*This project is still in early planning phase*

This is just some project that I am creating for helping with book keeping and administration within Guild Wars 2.  The
project grunt tasks are built for heroku, but should easily be modifiable to fit other type of environemnts.

## Development Environment Setup

Required: nodejs, npm, and bower.  
Publish requirement:  Heroku account setup with nodjs app and any Postgres based database.

Additionally,  the publishing repository should have server-config.json and .env set up.  These two files should never
be commited  into public repository.

Currently Requires installation of [postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/) database locally for local development.
